# Readme-Generator
For this assignment I created a Readme Generator.
When the I enter node index.js in the terminal, a series of questions to create Readme Generator are prompted to the user.
The questions ask for the title, description, install, how to use, contributions, how to test, license, github username, and email.
The user answers are then generated into text in a Readme.md file.
